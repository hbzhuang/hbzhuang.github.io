    Hi, I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">City University of Hong Kong</a>, advised by Prof. Xiaohua Jia (IEEE Fellow). My research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms, fault diagnosis, and fault-tolerant computing.  I am passionate about integrating graph theory with real-world applications to solve practical problems. I am always open to collaborative opportunities and welcome discussions with fellow researchers and practitioners.
